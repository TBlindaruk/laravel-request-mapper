# Contributing

Contributions are **welcome** and will be fully **credited**.

Please read and understand the contribution guide before creating an issue or pull request.

## Requirements

If the project maintainer has any additional requirements, you will find them listed here.

- **Add tests!** Your patch won't be accepted if it doesn't have tests.
- **Document any change in behaviour.** Make sure the `README.md` and any other relevant documentation are kept up-to-date.
- **Consider our release cycle.** We try to follow [SemVer v2.0.0](http://semver.org/). Randomly breaking public APIs is not an option.
- **One pull request per feature.** If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.

**Happy coding!**
